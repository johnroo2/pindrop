### Windborne Systems, Atlas Software Intern Notes || John Liu

<b><i>Which of the skill categories mentioned in the role description apply to you? Feel free to pick multiple.</i></b>

The following categories apply to me the most:
- <b>Web Dev/Design</b>
- <b>Linux & Python Infrastructure</b>
- <b>Data Science/Machine Learning</b>

In short, I have demonstrable experience in all the above categories in both personal and professional projects; here are a few (a lot of these are on my resume/[portfolio](https://john-liu.vercel.app) too):

- [SlimeScholars](https://slimescholars.com/)
  - A website for a gameified edtech platform using Next.js, Express, and MongoDB
- [Unfollowed.lol](https://unfollowed.lol/)
  - A website for a tool that scrapes and analyzes Instagram unfollows built using JavaScript, Django, Supabase, and GraphQL
- [Chess AI](https://github.com/johnroo2/normal-chess-api)
  - A chess AI that reached ~1600 Lichess elo using Flask and Tensorflow, trained on the cloud
- [DeepLearning-Racing](https://github.com/johnroo2/deeplearning-racing)
  - A self-driving car simulator that uses neuroevolution and deep learning to navigate a course built in Python

I have experience with DevOps and MLOps but not on a large scale, but I have worked with tools such as AWS ElasticBeanstalk/Bedrock/SageMaker and their Google/Microsoft equivalents. I have some experience with Ruby and C++ but they're comparitively weaker.

<b><i>Also, describe in one sentence what makes you good to work with</i> :)</b>

I really focus on the details, so my code should be easy to work with and understand. I also love working with and visualizing messy data, so I'd hope my preferences fit in well with the team.

<b><i>Add a sentence to the notes explaining why you chose the external api/dataset you did!</i></b>

I chose natural disasters and weather data because I thought that GDACS and weather data would have a lot of unique ways to present data on the frontend. To be honest, the weather/disaster datasets didn't really live up to my expectations but I wanted to finish this project quickly. 

I also wanted to make something useful, so I wanted to look into the growing issue that is climate change. I think this is a fun way to visualize the data and see how it looks like on a map.
